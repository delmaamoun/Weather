## Notes
- I ran out of time trying to implement reading test data from excel so you will find an "incomplete" data manager.
- Regarding the above, you should find a list of tests that should have been data-driven in Robot in the excel sheet in the Robot/Data Folder.
- There's a bug when sending special characters, particularly (") that I didn't get around to resolving.
- I am also missing tests against the response schema.
